Hello, everyone! Coming live from another day of self isolation and quarantinement. Spending time prepping for school, relaxing with the family, and living my bet Piscian artist life; when else would I have gotten the chance to draw and paint a huge freakin' avocado?
Some goals that I'm holding onto as these unfamiliar days become familiar:
-Stay positive and stay strong, no matter what
-Enjoy the time with family
-Take time to find ways to lend a helping hand.

Remember to take out for yourself when it's available in such sudden abundance for some; paint those nails, write that novel, call that one friend, whatever fills you up when it seems as thought the world is trying to wring you out like a washcloth.
That's it for today! Bye!
